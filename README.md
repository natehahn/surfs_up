# Surfs Up

### Overview

This assignment was a very straight forward request.  W. Avy requested that we provide data on temperature trends in Oahu during the months of June and December to determine whether his surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round.  We performed an analysis on a database using sqlalchemy and regular python expressions.  The outcomes will follow.

### Results

I was asked for two deliverable: 1. Provide the summary statistics for the month of June, and 2. Provide the summary statistics for the month of December.  When I ran the data for both of these months I made the following determinations:

  - Weather in the month of June and December is very similar. December has an average temperature of 71 degrees which is only four degrees colder than the average         temperature in June of 74 degrees.
  
  - Although the average is a difference of four degrees, December still see's max temperatures close to that of June.
  
  - Of note.  There were almost 200 more data points available for weather in June compared to December.  This could be cause by a number of issues with the               instruments at these sites.  However, I do not believe that these issues impact the overall quality of the statistics because those 200 data points would have to       have some extreme outliers to alter what we already have found.



Based on the provded information, I think it would be safe to open the shop if all other business aspects have been verified.
